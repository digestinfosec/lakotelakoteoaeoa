                    Daniel is firstly, trained in financial management and accounting, and secondly, a tech geek who loves playing with the latest technologies and electronics boards. It is this hobbyist streak of his that caused him to join the startup ecosystem in 2013 and take on projects many times more complex than his days as an auditor. As a keen analyst and consultant, Daniel has not only aggregated information about the day-to-day challenges startups face but has gone through the entire experience himself. Currently deepening his skills in data analysis he makes a key person and a good fit for the company&#39;s eventual goal of becoming the premier platform for workshops in South East Asia.
